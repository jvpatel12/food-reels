**🚀 Just launched FoodReels — the TikTok of food discovery!**

For years, I've watched people waste hours scrolling through endless menus trying to find their next favorite meal. Meanwhile, talented chefs and small food businesses struggle to reach customers who would love their food.

So I built **FoodReels** — a short-form video platform where food is front and center.

**Here's the problem we're solving:**
- 📱 Customers spend forever looking for food → We show them in 15-60 seconds
- 👨‍🍳 Small restaurants lack affordable marketing → We give them a free platform to showcase their craft
- 💰 Hidden fees and middlemen everywhere → We connect buyer and seller directly

**How it works:**
Swipe through food videos from local chefs. See something you love? Visit the store and order. That's it.

**The results (beta phase):**
✅ 10,000+ videos uploaded
✅ 50,000+ active users
✅ 500+ food partners
✅ 100,000+ orders completed

**Tech Stack:** React, Node.js, MongoDB, ImageKit, Stripe

This is just the beginning. We're building a community where food lovers and passionate food creators meet. No algorithms hiding quality content. Just real food from real people.

**If you're passionate about food, tech, or supporting small businesses — I'd love to connect!**

**📺 Why Video is the Future of Food Discovery**

Here's what we learned building FoodReels:

**1. Food is visual.** A 30-second video of a sizzling pan tells more than 100 words. People are 10x more likely to order after seeing a video.

**2. Short content wins.** We tested long-form vs. short-form. Short-form videos (15-60 sec) get 5x more engagement. People make food decisions in seconds, not minutes.

**3. Authenticity matters.** Over-edited ads get skipped. Raw, behind-the-scenes content from real chefs gets saved and shared.

**4. Creator economy is real.** Small restaurants can't afford $10k/month marketing. But they CAN create videos. We're leveling the playing field.

**The numbers don't lie:**
- Video content drives 80% of internet traffic
- 90% of food decisions are influenced by visual content
- Short-form video users spend 95+ minutes daily on platforms

**Our insight:** The food delivery industry is stuck in 2005 (lists & photos). Video is the next frontier.

That's why we built **FoodReels** — giving food creators a platform that actually works, and customers a way to discover food that excites them.

What's your biggest frustration with food discovery?
